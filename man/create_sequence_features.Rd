\usage{
create_sequence_features(intervals, size = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervals}{A data frame containing interval information with columns \code{start} and \code{end}.}

\item{size}{The size of the sequences to extract. If NULL, the size is calculated from the first interval.}
}
\value{
A matrix of normalized sequence features including GC content and dinucleotide frequencies.
}
\description{
This function generates sequence features from given intervals. It calculates
dinucleotide frequencies and GC content, normalizes these features, and returns
them as a matrix.
